// before (which is an unnecessary side-effect and doesnâ€™t keep the function pure),
// we want to use the models (and authenticated user etc.) from the functionâ€™s arguments.
// We are using the application-wide middleware to pass the models to all our routes in a context object now.
// We made the routing independent from all side-effects and pass everything needed to them via the request object with the context object.

// Error-handling middleware always takes four arguments. You must provide four arguments to identify
// it as an error-handling middleware function. Even if you donâ€™t need to use the next object,
// you must specify it to maintain the signature. Otherwise, the next object will be interpreted as
// regular middleware and will fail to handle errors.

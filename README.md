# express-postgresql-rest-boilerplate
An Express.js, PostgreSQL RestAPI Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate to create a Rest API with Express.js and PostgreSQL. It also has configurations for vscode, eslint and prettier.
This project is **heavily** based on [Creating a REST API with Express.js and PostgreSQL](https://www.robinwieruch.de/postgresql-express-node-rest-api/) tutorial by [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/) with some minimal tweaks.

It also contains settings for vscode to debug with nodemon and babel-node. I haven't tested it completely yet. I'll update if there are things that I've missed.

Great tutorials, all thanks to him!

An Express.js, PostgreSQL RestAPI Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate to create a Rest API with Express.js and PostgreSQL. It also has configurations for vscode, eslint and prettier.
This project is **heavily** based on [Creating a REST API with Express.js and PostgreSQL](https://www.robinwieruch.de/postgresql-express-node-rest-api/) tutorial by [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/) with some minimal tweaks.

Great tutorials, all thanks to him!
